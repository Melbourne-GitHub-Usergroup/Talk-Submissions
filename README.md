# Welcome to the Talk Submissions Repo for the Melbourne GitHub Usergroup

Welcome everyone.

In the style of being a GitHub usergroup I thought it would be good to use GitHub to help us with managing submissions for talks.

If you would like to speak at the Usergroup please do the following:
* fork this repo
* add in a text or markdown file with filename being your name and the submission for the talk within the file
* Raise a pull request against this repo.

The plan is that we can create a backlog of talks and work through so everyone gets a chance to speak.

If you have any questions please raise an issue or feel free to email me at dylan.v.mccarthy@gmail.com

We will try to announce the selected talks 2 weeks out from the event.
